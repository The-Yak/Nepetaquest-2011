Welcome, this is the github for the indie RPG Nepetaquest 2012, currently in development. Based on Andrew Hussie's webcomic Homestuck and a passing comment made to his Formspring account, this fan project is intended to create a fully playable game of reasonable length. It includes graphics, music and a game engine made from scratch specifically for this project, distinct from those used in playable Homestuck updates. It will be a standalone Java application, playable on any major OS. 

Nepetaquest 2012 is being worked on by approximately a dozen active contributors within the MSPA Forums, but any and all other participants are welcome.
